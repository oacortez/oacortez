### <div align="center">About me</div>
## <p align="center">
Ever since I was in middle school I was always exposed to websites and applications for phones. Since then I always had a curiousity on how all of these technologies worked and how users interact with that certain website/app. In 2017 I exposed my self to techonlogies such as Python and Swift even tho I never got to fully comprehend the languages it was a start to a new journey. Foward time till now, I am currently a mod 4 student at Turing School of Software & Design Learning Javascript, React, and more!
